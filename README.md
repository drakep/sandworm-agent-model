####                Sandworm Movment                             ####
##   This is a model of Sandworm behavior based on the novel Dune   ##
##   By Frank Herbert. According to the novel, sandworms do some     ##
##   easily modeled behavior, such as move around. They are also     ##
##   attracted to sound. They occasionally eat smaller worms. Here   ##
##   a tool used to attracted sandworms, called a thumper, is rep-   ##
##   resented by a green dot, made by clicking on the scene. Sand-   ##
##   are positions are represented by the moving red dots. Their     ##
##   past 4 positions by the yellow dots. Stationary red and blue    ##
##   dots represent sandworm corpses.
##
##  Update :: No more corpses, replaced by maturation mechanic
##         :: Sometimes a thumper kills a worm (Water of Life?)
